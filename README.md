## Description
This budgeting app allows users to track incoming and outgoing transactions, without the need for a constant internet connection. If the application does not have a connection at the time a transaction is entered, the transaction data is stored in the indexedDB until the connection is restored. Once the connection resumes, all stored data is transfered to the database. This application can also be downloaded for easy access and usage. 

## Installation
* Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
* Look over the `server.js` file and edit the connection parameters where needed.
* To start the app, run `npm start` and navigate to the link that is logged in the console (unless you have edited this, it should direct you to `http://localhost:3000`)
